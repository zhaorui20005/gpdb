title: About Management and Monitoring Utilities 
---

Greenplum Database provides standard command-line utilities for performing common monitoring and administration tasks.

Greenplum command-line utilities are located in the $GPHOME/bin directory and are run on the master host. Greenplum provides utilities for the following administration tasks:

-   Installing Greenplum Database on an array
-   Initializing a Greenplum Database System
-   Starting and stopping Greenplum Database
-   Adding or removing a host
-   Expanding the array and redistributing tables among new segments
-   Managing recovery for failed segment instances
-   Managing failover and recovery for a failed master instance
-   Backing up and restoring a database \(in parallel\)
-   Loading data in parallel
-   Transferring data between Greenplum databases
-   System state reporting

Greenplum Database includes an optional system monitoring and management database, `gpperfmon`, that administrators can enable. The `gpperfmon_install` command-line utility creates the `gpperfmon` database and enables data collection agents that collect and store query and system metrics in the database. Administrators can query metrics in the `gpperfmon` database. See the documentation for the `gpperfmon` database in the _Greenplum Database Reference Guide_.

VMware provides an optional system monitoring and management tool, Greenplum Command Center, which administrators can install and enable with Greenplum Database. Greenplum Command Center provides a web-based user interface for viewing system metrics and allows administrators to perform additional system management tasks. For more information about Greenplum Command Center, see the [Greenplum Command Center documentation](https://gpcc.docs.pivotal.io).
