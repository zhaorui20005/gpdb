## <a id="section2"></a>Synopsis 

```
<plugin_executable> backup_file <plugin_config_file> <file_to_backup>
```

## <a id="section3"></a>Description 

`gpbackup` invokes the `backup_file` plugin command on the master and each segment host for the file that `gpbackup` writes to a backup directory on local disk.

The `backup_file` implementation should process and copy the file to the remote storage system. Do not remove the local copy of the file that you specify with `file_to_backup`.

## <a id="section4"></a>Arguments 

plugin\_config\_file
:   The absolute path to the plugin configuration YAML file.

file\_to\_backup
:   The absolute path to a local backup file generated by `gpbackup`. Do not remove the local copy of the file that you specify with `file_to_backup`.

## <a id="section5"></a>Exit Code 

The `backup_file` command must exit with a value of 0 on success, non-zero if an error occurs. In the case of a non-zero exit code, `gpbackup` displays the contents of `stderr` to the user.
